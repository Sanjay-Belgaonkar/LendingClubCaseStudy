## General Information
- The aim of this case study is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Conclusions
From our EDA Analysis we conclude that a loan applicant is likely to be charged off under the following circumstances:
- If the applicant’s income falls in the range 0 – 20,000.
- If the applicant goes for longer term loan then applied interest rates will be higher.
- If the loan application is for small businesses.
- If the applicant falls in the F or G grades.
